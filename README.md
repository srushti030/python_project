# python_project


This Python project demonstrates a basic Student Management System using object-oriented programming and fundamental programming concepts like classes, functions, if-elif-else statements, and while loops.

The system allows users to:

Add Student Records: Input details like name, roll number, and marks.
View All Students: Display a list of all stored student information.
Search for a Student: Retrieve details using the roll number.
Update Student Details: Modify existing student data.
Delete Student Records: Remove a student's data from the system.
The program runs in a menu-driven format using a while loop, offering continuous user interaction until an exit option is chosen. Decision-making is implemented using if-elif-else statements to handle user choices effectively.

This project is a practical example for beginners to understand Python programming, problem-solving, and working with real-world data.
